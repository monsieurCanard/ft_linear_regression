🚗💰 **Predict the price of a car based on its mileage**

This project introduces you to machine learning by implementing a simple linear regression model to estimate a car's price based on its mileage. 📊

## Description

The model used is a linear function:

```estimatePrice(mileage) = θ₀ + (θ₁ × mileage)```

Where:

- tmp_`θ₀` is the y-intercept (bias)
- tmp`θ₁` is the slope (coefficient)

The training function adjusts these parameters to minimize the error between estimated and actual prices. 🎯
